## Generating a Password

To generate a password, first use the slider to select the desired length of your password.

The buttons can be toggled on or off. If a button is on, that character type will appear in your final password.

Once you have selected the character types you would like in your final password, click `Generate Password`, and your password will appear in the text area.
